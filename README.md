### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```

### 2. Start the System
```bash
# Start everything with Docker Compose (recommended)
docker compose up -d

# The system will be available at:
# - Web Interface: http://localhost:8020
# - API Documentation: http://localhost:8020/api/docs
# - Health Check: http://localhost:8020/health
```

### 3. Using the Voice Interface
1. Open http://localhost:8020 in your browser
2. Select an activity type (Fitness, Cricket Coaching, Match, or Rest Day)
3. Click the record button and speak about your activity
4. View the AI-processed structured data in real-time
